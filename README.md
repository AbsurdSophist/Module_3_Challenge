# Crypto Arbitrage
   In this project we examined arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin within two exchange markets: Bitstamp and Coinbase. By analyzing historical data and focusing on specific time periods, we are able to identify arbitrage opportunities, compute their profitability, and further speculate as to the viability of an arbitrage strategy in the future. 

# Technologies
   To collect, prepare, and analyze our historical data, we used the pandas and path libraries. This enabled us to pull in our data from a pre-constructed csv file, and then to clean, analyze, and plot our findings. 

# Findings
   After collecting and preparing the historical data in each exchange, we then focused in on particular time periods in the data. We chose three arbitrary dates from each year that our data was availabe (2016, 2017, and 2018). As you can see by the plots generated, significant arbitrage opportunities appear to exist in 2016 and 2017, but 2018 reveals consistant pricing among both exchanges, and thus arbitrage opportunities are sparce and without of little profitability. Additionally, we were able to focus on opportunites where the profit generated would be at least 1%, and from this focused data we were able to generate the profit sum for the given day being analyzed. While 2016 and 2017 each had many opportunities where profit was over 1%, the current price of Bitcoin made a significant difference as to the summation of profit accumulated. Because Bitcoin went from being traded in the hundreds of dollars in 2016 to thousands of dollars in 2017, the profit generated from our 2017 data from exceeded that of 2016. As mentioned previously, arbitrage opportunities became virtually nonexistant in 2018, which would question the viability (in terms of profitablility) of continue this strategy in the future.
